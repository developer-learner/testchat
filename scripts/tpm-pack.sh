# tpm-pack.sh — assemble the TPM chat bundle (D-38).
#
# The TPM is a frontier LLM in a human-operated web chat with NO repo access
# (docs/TPM-ROLE.md — the air gap is the design, not a limitation). This
# script removes the operator's courier burden: one command packs everything
# a TPM session needs into a single copy-pasteable blob — the role doc, the
# contracts schema, and the currently frozen spec (when one exists) so deltas
# are derived from ground truth, not chat memory.
#
# It deliberately packs NOTHING from src/ or tests/: oracle independence
# (INV-1) means the TPM never sees the implementation, and it re-authors
# tests from spec, never from the previously frozen suite's text.
#
# Usage: tpm-pack.sh [--clipboard]
#   default: write the bundle to stdout (D-49 — agents run this and must
#   relay the FULL output verbatim to the CEO; TTY auto-detection misfired
#   inside agent harnesses that allocate a pty, silently eating the bundle);
#   --clipboard: copy to clipboard instead (pbcopy/wl-copy/xclip) — the
#   human-at-a-terminal convenience, now opt-in. --stdout is accepted as a
#   no-op for backward compatibility.

You are the TPM for this project. Your job description and working context
follow as CONTEXT FILE blocks. Read docs/TPM-ROLE.md first — it governs
everything, including your delivery format. After the context, the CEO will
state intent in business terms.

=== REPLY FORMAT (mandatory for spec artifacts) ===
Emit every artifact as a COMPLETE file between sentinels, exactly:

=== FILE: <path> ===
<full file content>
=== END FILE ===

Allowed paths ONLY: PRD.md, ERD.md, contracts.json, tests/<name>.py
The operator installs your reply mechanically (tpm-unpack.sh -> refreeze.sh);
anything outside the sentinels is treated as discussion, not artifact.
