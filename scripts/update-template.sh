# update-template.sh — pull the template's control plane into this child (D-34).
#
# The refreeze pattern (D-31) applied to the OTHER protected artifact class:
# stage the template's current template-owned files, show the human one diff,
# interactive y/N, apply, re-pin hashes, advance .template-version, commit
# [template-update <sha>]. This is the fix for the spark-class incident —
# control-plane improvements flow template -> children instead of by hand.
#
# Usage:
#   update-template.sh [--from <clone-dir>] [--ref <ref>] [--dry-run] [--review]
#   update-template.sh --stamp [--from <clone-dir>]
#
#   --from     use an existing local clone of the template (else: gh repo clone
#              into a temp dir — needs gh auth for a private template)
#   --ref      template ref to update to (default: the clone's HEAD)
#   --dry-run  show what would change and exit; no tty needed, nothing written
#   --review   emit a self-contained review bundle (claims + diff + reviewer
#              instructions) for pasting into a SECOND model before the CEO
#              approves; no tty needed, nothing written. The CEO gate stays a
#              human authorization — this delegates the technical reading.
#   --stamp    only (re)write ref= in .template-version to the template's HEAD —
#              retrofits a child created before D-33. No files are copied.
#
# The approval screen presents plain-language claims (the template's commit
# messages for the update range), because the CEO's y/N is an AUTHORIZATION
# that the control plane changed with a human aware — not a code review.
# Correctness is carried by the template's selftests and the next run's gates.

# died mid-apply on `ho`, the tail of an `echo`). Re-exec from a disposable
