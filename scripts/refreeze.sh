# refreeze.sh — the ONLY path by which frozen TPM artifacts change (D-31).
#
# The TPM (frontier LLM in a human-operated web chat) authors the spec: PRD,
# ERD prose, machine-readable contracts, and the test suite. The operator
# saves the TPM's output (initial spec or an escalation delta) under a staging
# directory and runs this script, which:
#
#   1. shows the human a full diff of what would change,
#   2. requires human approval — interactive y/N, or the D-42 hash-bound
#      --diff / --approve flow (THE approval gate — no honor-strings),
#   3. applies the files, re-collects test node-ids, records the delta,
#   4. re-freezes: bumps VERSION, regenerates the hash manifest,
#      commits [refreeze vN].
#
# Wrongness gets a protocol instead of a workaround: frozen artifacts can be
# legitimately revised (bounded, versioned, human-approved) and can NEVER be
# silently mutated — every gate run verifies the frozen-manifest, fail-closed.
#
# Usage:
#   refreeze.sh [<staging-dir>]             interactive y/N (default gate, D-31)
#   refreeze.sh --diff [<staging-dir>]      validate + print full diff and its
#                                           DIFF-SHA, apply nothing (agent flow
#                                           step 1: conductor shows this to the CEO)
#   refreeze.sh --approve <sha> [<staging-dir>]
#                                           non-interactive apply, D-42: the sha
#                                           must match the recomputed diff hash;
#                                           the OpenCode "ask" permission prompt
#                                           on this exact command is the human
#                                           gate — the CEO approves a command
#                                           carrying the hash of the diff they read.
