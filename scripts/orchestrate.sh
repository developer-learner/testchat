# orchestrate.sh v3 — walks the EM's task DAG from a frozen TPM spec.
#
# Shell owns ALL procedure (D-05 applied uniformly, D-26): ordering, state,
# completion, escalation counters. LLM tiers only produce artifacts:
#   EM    -> tasks/plan.json (decomposition) and tasks/diagnosis.json (consults)
#   coder -> exactly one file per task, gate-enforced
# Tests are TPM-authored, frozen in scripts/.approved/ + tests/, and RUN by
# this script via pytest --json-report. There is no test-authoring agent.
#
# D-53: EM/coder are called over bare HTTP (scripts/llm-call.sh), one
# completion per call — no agent harness in the loop. The shell gathers
# context (reads the frozen files a call needs) into the prompt, sends it,
# and writes the model's answer to disk itself: a JSON artifact for the EM
# (schema-constrained), the one named file for the coder (sentinel-wrapped,
# same convention refreeze/tpm-unpack already use). This retires the
# `opencode serve` / `--attach` / agent-mode machinery (D-40..D-52), whose
# seams caused every failure of the first three supervised runs and caught
# none of them — the actual trust boundary was always the sandbox lanes and
# the gates below, never the harness.
#
# The TPM is a human-operated web chat: escalations are packaged as batched,
# copy-pasteable bundles under .pipeline-state/escalations/ (D-29), and its
# answers come back as a delta applied by scripts/refreeze.sh (D-31).
#
# Exit codes: 0 feature done (full frozen suite green) · 1 hard failure or
# gate violation · 2 halted awaiting TPM (escalation batch written).

Reply with ONLY edit blocks in this exact format, nothing else:
<<<<<<< SEARCH
(an EXACT, character-for-character copy of a short existing section — 3 to 10 lines)
=======
(that same section with the change applied)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
Rules:
- Each SEARCH must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the file. Copy it verbatim — same spaces, same quotes.
- Several small blocks, not one big one. Do not touch code outside your blocks. Do not reformat or reorder anything.
- Never include any line containing a think tag in a SEARCH section — anchor on nearby tag-free lines instead.
- In new code, never write the think tag as one literal string — construct it by concatenation, e.g. '<' + 'think>'.
- If the file already satisfies the brief, reply with exactly this line and nothing else: === NO CHANGES ===
- Verify each SEARCH against the file one more time before answering.
- Your reply's VERY FIRST line must be '<<<<<<< SEARCH' (or the NO CHANGES line). Do not analyze, plan, or explain anything — every design decision is already made in the brief. Prose before the blocks burns your output budget and truncates the edit mid-block.
- Every block must be COMPLETE working code — never a stub, placeholder, or '...' body. If the brief needs a new function, write its full body in the block."

# --- Delta-scoped edit permission (inverts D-65's default) -------------------
# D-65 kept the coder away from files the spec DECLARED unchanged, via a
# hand-maintained contracts.no_edit_files. Hand-maintained is the flaw: at
# testchat M29 that list held 3 of 12 files, so when .pipeline-state/tasks/
# lost its `done` markers every task read `pending` and the coder was one
# call away from rewriting app.js, chat.py, threads.py, index.html and
# websearch.py — none of which the delta touched. Nothing mechanical would
# have stopped it.
#
# So the default is inverted: a file the current delta does not touch is
# no-edit, rather than fair game. The permitted set is derived from the
# frozen delta (never hand-listed, so it cannot drift), using the same
# --affected computation the re-freeze reset uses — direct hits plus
# transitive dependents, which is precisely the pipeline's own notion of
# "invalidated by this delta".
#
# A file that does NOT yet exist is always editable: that is how greenfield
# and genuinely new files get written, and it keeps an initial build (whose
# delta touches nothing on disk) working unchanged.
