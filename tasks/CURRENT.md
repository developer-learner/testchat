# CURRENT.md — Session Notes

> This is the human-facing status page, NOT the spec. The PRD, ERD, contracts
> and test suite live frozen in `scripts/.approved/` + `tests/` and change
> only via `scripts/refreeze.sh` (D-31). Update this file at the start and end
> of every working session; halt notes (Rule 4) land here.

## Escalations In Flight

> Orchestrator exit 2 means a batch is waiting in
> `.pipeline-state/escalations/BATCH.md`. Track its round-trip here.

- [ ] Batch carried to the TPM chat: n/a
- [ ] TPM delta staged under `scripts/.approved/incoming/`: n/a
- [ ] Re-frozen as v[N] and orchestrator re-run: n/a

## Notes / Context

> Halt-and-notify notes (Rule 4) go here: what stopped, why, what decision is
> needed. Also temporary context for this session that isn't worth a
> DECISIONS.md entry.

Milestone plan:
- M1: Echo chat — backend returns canned response, frontend renders chat bubbles
- M2: Live LLM integration — real HTTP call to operator's local endpoint
- M3: Streaming (SSE) — token-by-token response
- M4: Conversation history — full context sent to LLM

## Definition of Done (per feature)

Mechanical checks:

- Full frozen suite green (`scripts/orchestrate.sh` exit 0)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` updated if structure changed
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` updated if a non-obvious choice was made
- No linter errors (`ruff check src/`)

The one judgment check (D-44 — the CEO's gate, never skipped or delegated):

- **CEO has used the running prototype and accepted the milestone.**
  "Tests green" means built-as-specified; only this means built-right.
  Record the acceptance here with a date.

Then: branch merged to main; entry moved to `BACKLOG.md` completed table

## Results

Full frozen TPM suite green against spec v2. Feature built and validated.
